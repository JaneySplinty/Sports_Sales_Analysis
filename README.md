## Project Overview
This project involved the creation of a Sports Sales Analysis Dashboard to provide comprehensive insights into sales performance across various metrics. The dashboard highlights key business indicators such as total revenue, total quantity sold, total profit, average order value (AOV), and total orders. It also presents a breakdown of sales performance by subcategories, product categories, countries, and customer gender, as well as the top-performing products by revenue.

The dashboard was designed to support data-driven decision-making, enabling stakeholders to identify trends, understand customer preferences, and optimize sales strategies.

## Problem Statement
Sports sales businesses face challenges in understanding detailed performance metrics such as:
- Identifying high-performing product categories and subcategories.
- Determining customer behavior trends based on gender.
- Analyzing sales performance across different countries.
- Recognizing top-performing products by revenue to focus marketing efforts.

Without a robust analytical approach, businesses risk inefficiencies and lost opportunities for growth. This project aims to address these challenges by visualizing critical data points in a clear and actionable format.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases the following data analysis and visualization skills:
- **Data Aggregation and Transformation**: Organizing raw sales data into meaningful metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating intuitive charts such as bar graphs, pie charts, and KPIs using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Breaking down complex datasets to extract actionable insights.
- **Dashboard Design**: Building a user-friendly interface to highlight the most relevant data points.

## Data Source
The data used in this project was derived from hypothetical sales records of a sports business. The dataset includes information on:
- Product categories (Accessories, Bikes, Clothing)
- Subcategories (e.g., Tires, Helmets, Jerseys)
- Sales performance across six countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States)
- Customer gender distribution
- Revenue, quantity, and profit metrics
